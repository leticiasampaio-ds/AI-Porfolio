# X-Ray Baggage Scanner Anomaly Detection

## Data source
Kaggle: [X-Ray Baggage Scanner Anomaly Detection.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/orvile/x-ray-baggage-anomaly-detection)

## Exploratory Data Analysis
- The dataset is composed of 5 object classes, all well-represented in train/val/test splits.
    - Class 2 is less frequent across all subsets, which may lead to class imbalance during training.
- All bounding boxes follow the YOLO format with normalized coordinates.
- All images in the dataset have a fixed resolution of *416Ã—416 pixels*

**About object size and aspect ratio**:  
- Classes vary significantly in bounding box dimensions. This suggests that anchor-based models may need tuning to better fit small vs large objects or anchor-free architectures must be considered.

## Preprocessing Techniques
Improve image quality and feature learnability.
1. Convert to Grayscale.
    - The task does not rely on color.
    - Reduces: computational costs; memory usage; risk of overfitting to meaningless RGB variations.
2. Denoising Filter
    - Bilateral Filter: reduce unwanted noise very well while keeping edges fairly sharp.
3. Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization.
    - Boosts local contrast without overexposing bright areas. Perfect for revealing subtle shapes like knives.
4. Normalization & Standardization
    - Normalize pixel values to [0, 1] to achieve faster convergence during training - keeps values within a consistent range.
    - Then standardize - makes distribution centered and unit-scaled.
